However, 2 players recorded habitual sleep only (i.e., no tour sleep data available). In addition, 3 players recorded tour sleep only (i.e., no habitual sleep data available). Thus, 5 participants were excluded from the analysis, where ath_id = c(\"09\", \"13\", \"14\", \"15\", \"16\"). All results reported here include the 11 players who recorded both habitual and on-tour sleep. 2.2 Key definitions In-flight sleep: The sleep obtained during the international travel from Melbourne to Chennai on 8 and 9 March. Distinct sleep bouts: From the actigraphy data, each bout of sleep is treated as a distinct observation. Example: A person has a nap and a night-time sleep occurring on the same date. When the data is represented at the per sleep bout level, the nap and night-time sleep would be captured as two distinct sleep bouts (i.e., one row of sleep data for each bout). Sleep per day: From the actigraphy data, each day of sleep is treated as a distinct observation. Example: A person who has a nap and a night-time sleep occurring on the same date. When the data is represented at the per day level, the nap and night-time sleep data is merged to produce a summary of the day’s sleep (i.e., one row of sleep data for each day). 2.3 Measures and variables Sleep via actigraphy Perceived jet-lag Self-reported well-being Internal load (Session-RPE) 2.4 Derived variables and formats 2.4.1 Habitual sleep Habitual sleep values are obtained from per-person per-day sleep monitoring data, with variables definitions as follows: Bed time: Mean bed time over n number of days monitored, expressed in HH:MM:SS format. Wake-up time: Mean wake-up time over n number of days monitored, expressed in HH:MM:SS format. Sleep duration (min): Mean sleep duration over n number of days monitored, expressed in minutes. Sleep duration (h): Mean sleep duration over n number of days monitored, expressed in decimal hours. Sleep latency: Mean sleep latency over n number of days monitored, expressed in minutes. Sleep efficiency: Mean sleep efficiency over n number of days monitored, expressed as a percentage. Wake duration: Mean wake duration over n number of days monitored, expressed in minutes. Wake bouts num: Mean number of wake bouts over n number of days monitored. Wake bouts average duration: Mean duration of wake bouts over n number of days monitored, expressed in decimal minutes. 2.4.2 Sleep per day The per day data has been calculated from the bout-level data as follows: Sleep duration: Total sleep duration from all sleep bouts that started on the same date, for each person. Sleep latency: Total sleep latency from all sleep bouts that started on the same date, for each person. Sleep efficiency: Efficiency across all sleep bouts that started on the same date, for each person. Click here for more details at back-calculating total time in bed, in order to calculate appropriately weighted values for sleep efficiency at the day-level. Wake duration: Total wake duration from all sleep bouts that started on the same date, for each person. Number of wake bouts: Total number of wake bouts from all sleep bouts that started on the same date, for each person. Average duration of wake bouts: Mean of the average wake bout duration from all sleep bouts that started on the same date, for each person. [JT note] THIS IS AN AVERAGE OF AN AVERAGE. Would be better to calculate this from total wake duration divided by number of wake bouts. 2.4.2.1 Back-calculating total time in bed and sleep efficiency The source data is recorded at the per sleep bout level (i.e., one row = one bout). For most of the sleep variables, it is straightforward to summarise to a per day level: e.g., total sleep duration in a day = the sum of sleep duration across all bouts in a day. For sleep efficiency, this is not as clear cut. At the bout level, sleep efficiency is some percentage of total time in bed (not exceeding 100%). To summarise this at the day-level, we cannot take a total as we would for other sleep variables. For example: a person records two sleep bouts in a day, each with 80% sleep efficiency. If we were to take a total to represent the day-level sleep efficiency, we end up with 80 + 80 = 160%…which doesn’t make sense in the context of this variable! Another approach could be to calculate average (mean) sleep efficiency across a person’s sleep bouts in a day, but this is not accurate either. 2.4.2.1.1 Example 1 A person records two sleep bouts in a day - one brief nap (say, 30 min) and one longer night-time sleep (say, 9 hours). From the nap, the person records 60% sleep efficiency. From the night-time sleep, the person records 90% sleep efficiency. If we average these sleep efficiency figures, then: \\(efficiency_{daymean} = \\frac {efficiency_{nap} + efficiency_{nightsleep}} {n_{bouts}}\\) \\(efficiency_{daymean} = \\frac {(60\\% + 90\\%)} {2}\\) \\(efficiency_{daymean} = {75\\%}\\) However, the problem with this approach is that the efficiency of each bout is given equal weighting in calculating the day’s average. This is despite the fact that the nap is much shorter than the night-time sleep. In this scenario, the mean of sleep efficiency across bouts is likely to underestimate the actual efficiency of sleep obtained across the day. 2.4.2.1.2 Example 2 A person records two sleep bouts in a day - one brief nap (say, 30 min) and one longer night-time sleep (say, 9 hours). From the nap, the person records 90% sleep efficiency. From the night-time sleep, the person records 60% sleep efficiency. If we apply the same averaging approach to this scenario as described for Example 1, the day-level sleep efficiency metric would work out to the same value = 75%. However, in this scenario, this calculation likely overestimates the actual efficiency of sleep obtained across the day, since the person obtained low sleep efficiency from the longest sleep bout in that day. 2.4.2.1.3 Returning to first principles A common way to calculate sleep efficiency is: \\({sleep\\ efficiency} = \\frac {sleep\\ duration} {total\\ time\\ in\\ bed}\\) In the source data, we have sleep efficiency and sleep duration, but not total time in bed. Following first principles, we expect that we can “back-calculate” total time in bed by re-organising the algebraic equation, i.e.: \\({total\\ time\\ in\\ bed} = \\frac {sleep\\ duration} {sleep\\ efficiency}\\) The code below steps through this “back-calculation” procedure, using the habitual sleep data. # Load libraries --------------------------------------------------------------- library(here) library(dplyr) library(knitr) library(kableExtra) # Import the tidy data --------------------------------------------------------- sleep_habitual &lt;- readRDS( here(&quot;outputs/sleep_habitual.rds&quot;)) # Wrangle the data ------------------------------------------------------------- sleep_habitual %&gt;% # Focus on key variables for this explanation select( ath_id, start_date, sleep_duration, sleep_latency, wake_duration, sleep_efficiency) %&gt;% # Back-calculate total time in bed mutate( total_time_in_bed = round( (sleep_duration / sleep_efficiency * 100), 0)) %&gt;% # Reorder columns select( ath_id, start_date, sleep_duration, sleep_efficiency, total_time_in_bed, sleep_latency, wake_duration ) -&gt; back_calc Table 2.1 below shows the results of back-calculating an estimate of total time in bed. # Display table ---------------------------------------------------------------- back_calc %&gt;% kable( caption = &#39;Total time in bed, estimated from habitual sleep variables.&#39;, booktabs = TRUE) %&gt;% kable_styling() %&gt;% scroll_box(width = &quot;800px&quot;, height = &quot;550px&quot;) Table 2.1: Total time in bed, estimated from habitual sleep variables. ath_id start_date sleep_duration sleep_efficiency total_time_in_bed sleep_latency wake_duration 11 2016-10-19 560 68.64 816 1 142 11 2016-10-20 451 79.08 570 0 88 11 2016-10-21 466 64.00 728 8 146 11 2016-10-22 573 65.76 871 22 164 11 2016-10-23 570 70.22 812 7 155 11 2016-10-24 542 80.47 674 10 97 11 2016-10-25 388 81.63 475 0 68 07 2016-10-18 471 76.35 617 10 103 07 2016-10-20 468 83.80 558 0 75 07 2016-10-20 484 89.90 538 0 48 07 2016-10-21 455 81.64 557 4 77 07 2016-10-22 477 82.64 577 0 82 07 2016-10-23 465 82.62 563 0 80 03 2016-10-24 422 78.01 541 0 92 03 2016-10-25 365 77.78 469 0 71 03 2016-10-26 397 77.13 515 9 80 03 2016-10-27 325 79.76 407 10 57 03 2016-10-28 389 76.06 511 4 84 02 2016-10-18 450 84.31 534 8 63 02 2016-10-19 512 79.05 648 6 97 02 2016-10-20 576 88.62 650 0 62 02 2016-10-21 530 88.32 600 0 61 02 2016-10-22 583 80.68 723 0 107 02 2016-10-30 255 96.09 265 0 9 01 2016-10-24 447 94.70 472 5 18 01 2016-10-25 487 93.65 520 0 30 01 2016-10-27 468 95.95 488 0 18 01 2016-10-28 412 90.56 455 0 38 01 2016-10-28 381 97.12 392 0 10 04 2016-11-28 478 90.98 525 9 34 04 2016-11-28 561 87.65 640 5 64 04 2016-11-29 641 89.41 717 0 67 04 2016-11-30 473 93.70 505 0 27 04 2016-12-01 558 84.14 663 40 54 08 2016-10-22 478 85.57 559 13 57 08 2016-10-23 482 76.61 629 13 102 08 2016-10-24 426 79.16 538 0 88 08 2016-10-25 461 80.30 574 0 90 08 2016-10-26 488 81.47 599 2 88 12 2016-11-27 496 77.97 636 87 36 12 2016-11-28 547 86.74 631 2 63 12 2016-11-29 502 93.27 538 2 31 12 2016-11-30 473 93.70 505 0 27 12 2016-12-01 552 88.01 627 14 53 10 2016-10-31 557 92.28 604 25 19 10 2016-11-01 511 88.42 578 1 30 10 2016-11-03 370 97.57 379 0 8 10 2016-11-03 490 92.04 532 18 16 10 2016-11-04 460 89.92 512 25 23 10 2016-11-05 546 93.23 586 14 23 06 2016-10-17 486 87.25 557 11 48 06 2016-10-18 551 89.95 613 2 50 06 2016-10-19 569 88.07 646 0 67 06 2016-10-20 525 86.06 610 4 68 06 2016-10-21 459 85.62 536 6 60 05 2016-10-18 413 89.37 462 0 43 05 2016-10-19 461 88.49 521 1 46 05 2016-10-20 461 82.52 559 6 74 05 2016-10-22 483 84.16 574 40 42 05 2016-10-24 405 90.65 447 2 27 Applying the same approach to bout-level sleep data from the tour period, we can calculate an appropriate day-level metric for sleep efficiency through this process: For each bout, back-calculate total time in bed using the formula above (sleep_duration / sleep_efficiency). Calculate day-level totals for time in bed and sleep duration. Calculate day-level sleep efficiency as: \\(efficiency_{day-level} = \\frac {total\\ time\\ in\\ bed_{day}} {sleep\\ duration_{day}}\\) 2.5 Analysis The content below has been copied over from the GitHub repo for this analysis. 2.5.1 Research question 1 What changes occur in sleep characteristics, perceptions of jetlag, and self-reported well-being over the course of an international T20 tournament and following an international flight? 2.5.1.1 Analysis methods Descriptive statistics Plots 2.5.1.2 Notes Objective sleep data can be presented as absolute values and relative-to-habitual values. 2.5.2 Research question 2 What is the impact of sleep obtained during an international flight on the subsequent sleep, self-reported well-being, and perceptions of jetlag upon arrival at the competition destination? 2.5.2.1 Analysis methods Use the in-flight sleep to group athletes into categories via median split. For example, a low quantity vs. high quantity? Using data only from the n = 8 with habitual + in-flight sleep data, the median is 11.7 h sleep accumulated across the two flights from Melbourne to Chennai. So the ‘low’ group would have recorded &lt;= 11.7 h in-flight sleep and the ‘high’ group would have recorded &gt; 11.7 h (in this example). Then we could scale each athlete’s on-tour sleep data to their habitual sleep data, to calculate how far each night of sleep ‘deviates’ from habitual. This would allow us to use each night of post-flight, on-tour sleep as a data point. With n = 8, this is 91 observations in total; 48 in the ‘high quantity’ group, 43 in the ‘low quantity’ group. To compare these groups, I would use a simple pairwise statistic such as the independent t test (parametric) or the Mann-Whitney test (non-parametric), coupled with an effect size calculation (e.g., standardised mean difference). The number of observations is different for the other measures (well-being, perceptions of jetlag) but the general analytical process would be the same. 2.5.3 Research question 3 What are the relationships between training and match day load, perceptions of wellbeing and jetlag, and objective sleep characteristics during an international tournament? 2.5.3.1 Analysis methods For n = 13 athletes who recorded some objective sleep data during the tour: Relationship: Internal load on subsequent sleep. Number of paired observations: n(paired obs) = 126 Relationship: Well-being on subsequent sleep. n(paired obs) = 145 Relationship: Perceived jetlag on subsequent sleep. n(paired obs) = 85 Given these numbers, we can address this research question with bivariate correlations (Pearson’s for parametric data, Spearman’s for non-parametric). 2.5.4 Notes For this analysis, are we going to scale to habitual sleep as well? Not sure that we need to here, happy to chat about it though. "],

Histogram + density plots for each measure are shown below. 10.1.2 Sleep 10.1.3 Internal load - All variables 10.1.4 Internal loads - Selected variables 10.1.5 Perceived jetlag 10.1.6 Perceived well-being 10.2 Load on Sleep ## Joining, by = &quot;sleep_variable&quot; 10.2.1 Correlation scatter plots: Internal loads on subsequent sleep 10.2.2 Correlation coefficients tables 10.2.2.1 Internal training load on subsequent sleep sleep_variable load_train_total_r load_train_total_p sleep_duration_sum -0.04 0.70 sleep_latency_mean 0.01 0.89 sleep_efficiency_mean -0.14 0.16 wake_duration_sum 0.09 0.37 wake_bouts_num_sum 0.13 0.21 wake_bouts_avg_duration_mean -0.01 0.89 10.2.2.2 Internal playing load on subsequent sleep sleep_variable load_play_total_r load_play_total_p sleep_duration_sum -0.15 0.48 sleep_latency_mean 0.05 0.80 sleep_efficiency_mean 0.14 0.50 wake_duration_sum -0.38 0.06 wake_bouts_num_sum -0.24 0.25 wake_bouts_avg_duration_mean -0.10 0.64 10.3 Well-being on Sleep ## Joining, by = &quot;sleep_variable&quot; 10.3.1 Correlation scatter plots: Well-being on subsequent sleep 10.3.2 Correlation coefficients tables 10.3.2.1 Fatigue on subsequent sleep sleep_variable Fatigue_r Fatigue_p sleep_duration_sum -0.03 0.73 sleep_latency_mean 0.14 0.08 sleep_efficiency_mean 0.07 0.41 wake_duration_sum -0.11 0.16 wake_bouts_num_sum -0.14 0.08 wake_bouts_avg_duration_mean 0.00 0.99 10.3.2.2 Sleep quality on subsequent sleep sleep_variable Sleep_r Sleep_p sleep_duration_sum -0.16 0.05 sleep_latency_mean 0.06 0.42 sleep_efficiency_mean -0.12 0.13 wake_duration_sum -0.02 0.80 wake_bouts_num_sum -0.07 0.37 wake_bouts_avg_duration_mean 0.11 0.15 10.3.2.3 Soreness on subsequent sleep sleep_variable Soreness_r Soreness_p sleep_duration_sum -0.03 0.72 sleep_latency_mean 0.08 0.32 sleep_efficiency_mean -0.11 0.15 wake_duration_sum 0.08 0.31 wake_bouts_num_sum 0.05 0.55 wake_bouts_avg_duration_mean 0.16 0.05 10.3.2.4 Stress on subsequent sleep sleep_variable Stress_r Stress_p sleep_duration_sum 0.06 0.46 sleep_latency_mean -0.02 0.80 sleep_efficiency_mean -0.04 0.65 wake_duration_sum 0.08 0.33 wake_bouts_num_sum 0.04 0.63 wake_bouts_avg_duration_mean 0.21 0.01 10.3.2.5 Overall well-being on subsequent sleep sleep_variable overall_wellbeing_score_r overall_wellbeing_score_p sleep_duration_sum 0.01 0.95 sleep_latency_mean 0.03 0.72 sleep_efficiency_mean -0.06 0.47 wake_duration_sum 0.08 0.33 wake_bouts_num_sum 0.05 0.52 wake_bouts_avg_duration_mean 0.17 0.03 10.4 Jetlag on Sleep ## Joining, by = &quot;sleep_variable&quot; 10.4.1 Correlation scatter plots: Jetlag on subsequent sleep 10.4.2 Correlation coefficients sleep_variable jetlag_am_r jetlag_am_p jetlag_pm_r jetlag_pm_p sleep_duration_sum -0.03 0.81 -0.02 0.87 sleep_latency_mean -0.03 0.76 -0.01 0.95 sleep_efficiency_mean -0.14 0.21 0.16 0.15 wake_duration_sum 0.20 0.08 -0.08 0.47 wake_bouts_num_sum 0.23 0.04 -0.01 0.93 wake_bouts_avg_duration_mean 0.07 0.51 -0.11 0.35 "]
