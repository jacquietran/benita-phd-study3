What is the impact of in-flight sleep on the subsequent tournament sleep, self-reported well-being, and perceptions of jetlag upon arrival at the competition destination?’ What are the relationships between training and match day load, perceptions of wellbeing and jetlag, and objective sleep characteristics during an international tournament?

Distinct sleep bouts: From the actigraphy data, each bout of sleep is treated as a distinct observation. Example: A person has a nap and a night-time sleep occurring on the same date. When the data is represented at the per sleep bout level, the nap and night-time sleep would be captured as two distinct sleep bouts (i.e., one row of sleep data for each bout). Sleep per day: From the actigraphy data, each day of sleep is treated as a distinct observation. Example: A person who has a nap and a night-time sleep occurring on the same date. When the data is represented at the per day level, the nap and night-time sleep data is merged to produce a summary of the day’s sleep (i.e., one row of sleep data for each day). 2.2 Measures and variables Sleep via actigraphy Perceived jet-lag Self-reported well-being Internal load (Session-RPE) 2.3 Derived variables and formats 2.3.1 Habitual sleep Habitual sleep values are obtained from per-person per-day sleep monitoring data, with variables definitions as follows: Bed time: Mean bed time over n number of days monitored, expressed in HH:MM:SS format. Wake-up time: Mean wake-up time over n number of days monitored, expressed in HH:MM:SS format. Sleep duration (min): Mean sleep duration over n number of days monitored, expressed in minutes. Sleep duration (h): Mean sleep duration over n number of days monitored, expressed in decimal hours. Sleep latency: Mean sleep latency over n number of days monitored, expressed in minutes. Sleep efficiency: Mean sleep efficiency over n number of days monitored, expressed as a percentage. Wake duration: Mean wake duration over n number of days monitored, expressed in minutes. Wake bouts num: Mean number of wake bouts over n number of days monitored. Wake bouts average duration: Mean duration of wake bouts over n number of days monitored, expressed in decimal minutes. 2.3.2 Sleep per day The per day data has been calculated from the bout-level data as follows: Sleep duration: Total sleep duration from all sleep bouts that started on the same date, for each person. Sleep latency: Total sleep latency from all sleep bouts that started on the same date, for each person. Sleep efficiency: Mean sleep efficiency from all sleep bouts that started on the same date, for each person. [JT note] THIS IS CALCULATED FROM THE RAW SLEEP EFFICIENCY VALUES. May be better to calculate from total sleep time / total time-in-bed. Wake duration: Total wake duration from all sleep bouts that started on the same date, for each person. Number of wake bouts: Total number of wake bouts from all sleep bouts that started on the same date, for each person. Average duration of wake bouts: Mean of the average wake bout duration from all sleep bouts that started on the same date, for each person. [JT note] THIS IS AN AVERAGE OF AN AVERAGE. Would be better to calculate this from total wake duration divided by number of wake bouts. 2.4 Analysis "],
