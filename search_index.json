What is the impact of in-flight sleep on the subsequent tournament sleep, self-reported well-being, and perceptions of jetlag upon arrival at the competition destination?’ What are the relationships between training and match day load, perceptions of wellbeing and jetlag, and objective sleep characteristics during an international tournament?

However, 2 players recorded habitual sleep only (i.e., no tour sleep data available). In addition, 3 players recorded tour sleep only (i.e., no habitual sleep data available). Thus, 5 participants were excluded from the analysis, where ath_id = c(\"09\", \"13\", \"14\", \"15\", \"16\"). All results reported here include the 11 players who recorded both habitual and on-tour sleep. 2.2 Key definitions In-flight sleep: The sleep obtained during the international travel from Melbourne to Chennai on 8 and 9 March. Distinct sleep bouts: From the actigraphy data, each bout of sleep is treated as a distinct observation. Example: A person has a nap and a night-time sleep occurring on the same date. When the data is represented at the per sleep bout level, the nap and night-time sleep would be captured as two distinct sleep bouts (i.e., one row of sleep data for each bout). Sleep per day: From the actigraphy data, each day of sleep is treated as a distinct observation. Example: A person who has a nap and a night-time sleep occurring on the same date. When the data is represented at the per day level, the nap and night-time sleep data is merged to produce a summary of the day’s sleep (i.e., one row of sleep data for each day). 2.3 Measures and variables Sleep via actigraphy Perceived jet-lag Self-reported well-being Internal load (Session-RPE) 2.4 Derived variables and formats 2.4.1 Habitual sleep Habitual sleep values are obtained from per-person per-day sleep monitoring data, with variables definitions as follows: Bed time: Mean bed time over n number of days monitored, expressed in HH:MM:SS format. Wake-up time: Mean wake-up time over n number of days monitored, expressed in HH:MM:SS format. Sleep duration (min): Mean sleep duration over n number of days monitored, expressed in minutes. Sleep duration (h): Mean sleep duration over n number of days monitored, expressed in decimal hours. Sleep latency: Mean sleep latency over n number of days monitored, expressed in minutes. Sleep efficiency: Mean sleep efficiency over n number of days monitored, expressed as a percentage. Wake duration: Mean wake duration over n number of days monitored, expressed in minutes. Wake bouts num: Mean number of wake bouts over n number of days monitored. Wake bouts average duration: Mean duration of wake bouts over n number of days monitored, expressed in decimal minutes. 2.4.2 Sleep per day The per day data has been calculated from the bout-level data as follows: Sleep duration: Total sleep duration from all sleep bouts that started on the same date, for each person. Sleep latency: Total sleep latency from all sleep bouts that started on the same date, for each person. Sleep efficiency: Mean sleep efficiency from all sleep bouts that started on the same date, for each person. [JT note] THIS IS CALCULATED FROM THE RAW SLEEP EFFICIENCY VALUES. May be better to calculate from total sleep time / total time-in-bed. Wake duration: Total wake duration from all sleep bouts that started on the same date, for each person. Number of wake bouts: Total number of wake bouts from all sleep bouts that started on the same date, for each person. Average duration of wake bouts: Mean of the average wake bout duration from all sleep bouts that started on the same date, for each person. [JT note] THIS IS AN AVERAGE OF AN AVERAGE. Would be better to calculate this from total wake duration divided by number of wake bouts. 2.5 Analysis "],

The variable n_nights indicates the number of habitual sleep nights recorded by each athlete. 3.1 Per player The data displayed in Table 3.1 shows habitual sleep summary data for each player. One row = one player’s habitual sleep measures, expressed as per-day means. Example interpretation: During the habitual sleep period, the average bed time of athlete 01 was 11:41 PM and their average wake-up time was 7:00 AM.

Note: The in-flight period covers two days, so individual means and standard deviations should be interpreted in this context. Wide standard deviations are not a cause for concern, but rather a reflection of these statistics being summaries of only 2 observations per person. 4.2 Team summary 4.2.1 Table: Per sleep bout 4.2.2 Plots: Daily sleep From the plots below, an example interpretation is: On average, players obtained less than their habitual sleep duration on the first night of in-flight sleep (habitual sleep = 7.97 h; in-flight, 1st night = 5.69 h).
