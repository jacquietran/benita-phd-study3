# Introduction

For Study 3, the research questions are:

1. What changes occur in sleep characteristics, perceptions of jetlag, and self-reported well-being:
     - During an international flight (i.e., **in-flight sleep**), and
     - Over the course of an international T20 tournament following the international flight (i.e., **tournament sleep**?
2. What is the impact of **in-flight sleep** on the subsequent **tournament sleep**, self-reported well-being, and perceptions of jetlag upon arrival at the competition destination?â€™
3. What are the relationships between training and match day load, perceptions of wellbeing and jetlag, and objective sleep characteristics during an international tournament?
